# Fee Configuration Schema

This project uses a custom fee configuration schema for NEAR Intents 1Click API.

The complete schema specification is in `docs/fee-config-schema.md`.

Key rules:
- It's frontend/backend package used as NPM package
- Use TypeScript and transpile to JavaScript with commonly used setup
- Don't import any external dependencies
- Write functional code and keep files structure simple and clean
- Create extensive unit testing for all the functions with number of examples
- All fee configurations must validate against the schema
- Use `in`/`out` for swap directions (not `from`/`to`)
- Amount constraints (`min`/`max`) only apply to input amounts
- Priority determines rule evaluation order (higher = first)
- At least one of blockchain/symbol/assetId must be specified
- Keep versioning consistent and don't add any new feature unless explicitly mentioned
- Again, omit any features mentioned under "Future Enhancements" section
